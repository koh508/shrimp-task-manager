**Select Connection:** `INPUT[inlineListSuggester(optionQuery(#project), optionQuery(#area)):connections]`
**Purpose**:
This documentation establishes detailed safety protocols designed for **high-risk, cutting-edge technologies** in both space tourism and autonomous vehicle AI. By developing a unified safety protocol, we aim to standardize safety practices across industries where human lives are directly impacted by AI-driven or high-tech systems.

**Contents**:

1. **Risk Assessment and Mitigation**

    - **Risk Categorization**: Identifies and categorizes risks into high, medium, and low severity for both autonomous vehicles and space tourism, including risks like system malfunctions, emergency override failures, and environmental hazards.
    - **Mitigation Strategies**: Includes cross-industry protocols for risk reduction, such as redundant sensor systems for autonomous vehicles and multiple life-support backups in space tourism.
    - **Emergency Preparedness**: Establishes comprehensive emergency protocols, including rapid response systems, predefined evacuation procedures, and in-vehicle/system alerts.
2. **Safety Testing Requirements**

    - **Scenario-Based Testing**: Outlines simulated testing for potential failure points, such as unexpected obstacles for autonomous vehicles or rapid decompression for orbital hotels.
    - **Mock Incident Simulations**: Space tourism companies must conduct launch and landing simulations, while autonomous vehicle companies test crash avoidance. Both will provide documented results from each test.
3. **Training and Certification**

    - **Personnel Requirements**: Lists mandatory qualifications for personnel involved in both fields, including pilot certification for spacecraft and safety compliance certification for autonomous vehicle engineers.
    - **Public Safety Standards**: Establishes guidelines for customer safety education, ensuring that both vehicle passengers and space tourists are aware of system limitations and emergency protocols.
4. **Documentation and Public Accountability**

    - **Incident Reporting**: Details requirements for transparent incident reporting and public accountability, which includes quarterly safety reports, performance audits, and detailed documentation of any major incidents.
