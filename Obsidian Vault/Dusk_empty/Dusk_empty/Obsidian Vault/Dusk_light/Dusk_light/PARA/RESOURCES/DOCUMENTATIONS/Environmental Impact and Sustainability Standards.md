**Select Connection:** `INPUT[inlineListSuggester(optionQuery(#project), optionQuery(#area)):connections]` 
**Purpose**:  
This document establishes **sustainability standards** and protocols to minimize the environmental impact of both space tourism and data centers. As these industries expand, it is essential to create robust frameworks to limit resource use and protect ecological systems.

**Contents**:

1. **Greenhouse Gas Emission Targets**
    
    - **Emissions Benchmarks**: Sets specific targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions by a percentage each year, with separate goals for space launches and data center operations.
    - **Measurement Tools**: Lists approved tools for measuring emissions accurately, such as carbon tracking software and lifecycle assessment methodologies.
2. **Sustainable Resource Use**
    
    - **Water and Energy Conservation**: Defines standards for reducing water use in data centers and efficient fuel use in space launches.
    - **Recycling Protocols**: Outlines recycling practices for electronic waste and hardware components in both industries.
3. **Sustainable Supply Chain Standards**
    
    - **Vendor Requirements**: Details requirements for vendors to align with sustainability goals, focusing on renewable materials and fair labor practices.
    - **Supply Chain Audits**: Establishes regular audits to ensure compliance with sustainability guidelines across all supplier networks.
4. **Sustainable Design Principles**
    
    - **Green Building Standards**: Provides guidance on constructing eco-friendly facilities, from data centers to ground control hubs for space tourism.
    - **Lifecycle Management**: Defines practices for extending the lifecycle of equipment through maintenance and recycling.
5. **Community and Environmental Impact Assessments**
    
    - **Impact Studies**: Requirements for conducting environmental impact studies before expansion projects to assess potential harm to local ecosystems and communities.
    - **Community Engagement**: Sets protocols for involving local communities in sustainability efforts, including education and awareness programs.
