# [[2. Autonomous Vehicle AI Ethics]] 
# Overview
This strategy document focuses on building **user trust** in autonomous vehicles to encourage widespread adoption. Public trust is crucial for the success of autonomous vehicles, as many consumers remain hesitant about the technology.

- **User Experience Enhancements**:
    - **User Control Options**: Ensure that users feel empowered by providing options for customization and manual control.
    - **Clear AI Feedback**: The vehicle’s interface should provide real-time feedback on AI decisions to make users feel informed and involved.
- **Safety Assurance**:
    - **Transparency in AI Behavior**: The vehicle’s interface should make it clear how the AI is assessing the road and making decisions, especially in critical situations.
    - **Public Demonstrations and Trials**: Conduct public trials in which consumers can test autonomous vehicles in a safe environment.
- **Adoption Milestones**:
    - **Phase 1**: Target early adopters by launching limited tests in select urban areas.
    - **Phase 2**: Expand availability as more user data is gathered and the AI improves.
    - **Phase 3**: National rollout, supported by a broad educational campaign on the benefits of autonomous technology.
