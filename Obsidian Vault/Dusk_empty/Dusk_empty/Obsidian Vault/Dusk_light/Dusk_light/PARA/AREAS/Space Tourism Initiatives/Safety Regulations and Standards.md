# Overview
Safety is paramount in space tourism, and this note establishes the **baseline safety protocols** required for human space travel. The document compiles research on both national and international regulations, looking at examples from NASA, the European Space Agency, and private aviation standards.

- **Standards to Address**: Key areas include **radiation shielding**, emergency evacuation procedures, and thermal controls.
- **Case Studies**: Analysis of historical incidents, like those from the Space Shuttle program, to identify preventive measures that can be adapted for commercial flights.
- **Next Steps**: Collaborate with regulatory bodies and international agencies to align our safety standards with global expectations.
