# [[2. Autonomous Vehicle AI Ethics]] 
# Overview
This protocol defines the standards for **data-sharing agreements** between Tesla and Google, focusing on **privacy, security, and user consent**. Data-sharing is crucial for refining AI models and improving autonomous vehicle performance, but it must be done responsibly.

- **Data Types and Use Cases**:
    - **Anonymized Driving Data**: For AI training, anonymized data on driving patterns and obstacle detection.
    - **Incident Data**: Sharing anonymized data on near-miss and collision events to improve AI decision-making.
- **Privacy Measures**:
    - **Data Anonymization**: Ensures that all shared data is stripped of personally identifiable information (PII).
    - **Encryption Standards**: Sets AES-256 encryption for data transfer and storage, meeting global data protection standards.
- **User Consent**: Recommendations for a user consent framework, providing transparency on data usage and allowing users to opt in or out of specific data-sharing programs.
- **Compliance Requirements**: Aligns with GDPR, CCPA, and other international data privacy laws.
