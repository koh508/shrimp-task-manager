**Summary:**  
In her study, Ann Masten defines resilience as the **ordinary magic** that enables individuals, especially children, to overcome challenges. Her **2001 paper** in developmental psychology describes resilience as **an inherent human quality**, emerging from **protective factors** such as **positive relationships** and a **supportive environment**. Masten argues that resilience is **not rare** but rather **common**, suggesting that resilience is a **normal adaptive response** to adversity.

**Key Insights:**

- Resilience is **developed through social support** and **environmental stability**.
- Rather than a rare trait, resilience is a **widespread adaptive ability**.
- The study has applications in **mental health** and **developmental psychology**.

**Critique:**  
Although Masten’s theory is widely accepted, some argue that **resilience requires intentional effort** and **isn’t always “ordinary.”** Critics suggest that resilience can vary greatly depending on **individual temperament** and **specific circumstances**.
