# [[2. Autonomous Vehicle AI Ethics]] 
# Overview
This document provides a comprehensive set of **safety and redundancy protocols** designed to minimize risks associated with autonomous vehicles. The protocols emphasize a multi-layered approach to safety, ensuring that if one system fails, backup mechanisms are in place to prevent accidents.

- **Emergency Manual Override**:
    - **System Design**: All autonomous vehicles must be equipped with a manual override system that allows human drivers to assume control instantly.
    - **Testing Requirements**: Every manual override system undergoes extensive testing under various scenarios, including software failures and emergency situations.
- **Redundant Sensor Networks**:
    - **Dual-Sensor Systems**: Autonomous vehicles should utilize redundant sensor systems (e.g., radar, lidar, and cameras) to cross-verify data and improve accuracy in obstacle detection.
    - **Fallback Mechanisms**: Establishes automatic failover processes that activate backup sensors or systems if primary sensors malfunction.
- **Crash Avoidance Algorithms**:
    - **Real-Time Decision-Making**: Details the need for advanced algorithms that can make split-second decisions to avoid collisions.
    - **Predictive Analysis**: Algorithms should anticipate potential hazards, allowing for smoother and safer navigation.
