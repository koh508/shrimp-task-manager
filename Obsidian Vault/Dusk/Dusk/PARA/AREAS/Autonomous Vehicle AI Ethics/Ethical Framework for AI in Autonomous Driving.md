# [[2. Autonomous Vehicle AI Ethics]] 
# Overview
This document lays out the **ethical framework** for the design, development, and deployment of AI systems in autonomous vehicles. The frameworkâ€™s goal is to ensure that AI operates within defined moral and ethical boundaries, prioritizing **human safety, fairness, and accountability**.

- **Core Principles**:
    - **Transparency**: AI decision-making should be explainable and interpretable, allowing users and regulators to understand how decisions are made in various driving scenarios.
    - **Accountability**: Clear responsibility structures for AI-driven actions. In case of failures or malfunctions, accountability should be traceable to specific processes, either in AI programming or operational oversight.
    - **Equity**: Ensures that AI in autonomous vehicles serves diverse populations without bias in data or design.
- **Guidelines for Development**: AI models must be tested across diverse demographics and driving environments to ensure robustness and inclusivity.
- **Public Disclosure Requirements**: Recommendations for regular public disclosures on AI system updates and safety improvements to build and maintain trust among users.
