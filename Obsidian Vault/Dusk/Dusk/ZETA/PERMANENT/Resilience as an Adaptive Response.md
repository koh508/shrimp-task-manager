Resilience is often considered a **cornerstone of human development**, allowing individuals to **endure hardships** and emerge stronger. Ann Masten's 2001 study on resilience highlights its nature as an **adaptive response** to adversity, often supported by **social bonds** and a **positive environment**. Masten’s view of resilience as an **“ordinary magic”** underscores its **universality** and importance. This adaptive trait, whether seen in **psychological** or **social contexts**, enables growth and **sustained effort** even through life’s toughest challenges.
