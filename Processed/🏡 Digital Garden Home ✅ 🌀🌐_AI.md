Welcome, fellow wanderers, to my world, my [🏡 Digital Garden Home ✅ 🌀🌐](https://wanderloots.xyz/)

I created this [digital garden](https://wanderloots.xyz/digital-garden/published/what-is-a-digital-garden/) because I believe that our society places too much emphasis on perfection and I am trying a new experiment: [Learning in Public](https://wanderloots.xyz/digital-garden/published/learn-in-public/) as part of a [Public Personal Knowledge Management System](https://wanderloots.xyz/digital-garden/published/public-personal-knowledge-management-system/) 👀

As an [artist, intellectual property lawyer, patent agent, and graduated mechanical & materials science engineering](https://wanderloots.xyz/digital-garden/published/my-story-who-i-am-and-why-i-m-here/) I have become very good at learning complicated topics quickly, distilling them to their core ideas, and teaching others.

The goal is to plant these idea seeds along various paths in my [mind garden](https://wanderloots.xyz/digital-garden/published/what-is-a-digital-garden/). I can [Cultivate](https://wanderloots.xyz/digital-garden/published/cultivating-knowledge/) these seeds over time as I retrace my own thoughts, nurturing them into [Knowledge & Wisdom](https://wanderloots.xyz/404) as I develop [Original Thinking](https://wanderloots.xyz/vault/alloys/original-thinking/).

Instead of writing these work-in-progress notes in private, taking weeks to put them into a shareable format (YouTube, Newsletter, Social Media), I wanted a place to " **learn out loud** " online so that you can gain immediate value while I continue editing my long-form writing. A [Public Personal Knowledge Management System](https://wanderloots.xyz/digital-garden/published/public-personal-knowledge-management-system/).

Another goal of this garden is to teach you how to build your own website 🌱 - to paint your own corner of the Internet 🎨. I think that [self-sovereignty is underrated](https://wanderloots.xyz/digital-garden/published/self-sovereignty-is-underrated/) and we should *all be building our own websites* in this [Attention Economy](https://wanderloots.xyz/404) rather than spending all of our energy on social media.

Enough with the introduction, time to start exploring 👀
