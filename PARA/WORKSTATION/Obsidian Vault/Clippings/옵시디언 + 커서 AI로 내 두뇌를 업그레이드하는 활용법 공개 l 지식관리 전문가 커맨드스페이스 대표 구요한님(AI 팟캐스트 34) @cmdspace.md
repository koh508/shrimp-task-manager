Hi Friends, my name is Callum aka wanderloots. In today's video, I walk through practical examples of how I use NotebookLM with Obsidian to add a dynamic element to my note-taking & surface insights 📝💡  
  
Google's NotebookLM truly adds a conversational element to selected portions of your Obsidian Vault, augmenting what I can use it for in many ways ✨ New ideas, surfacing insights, making connections, distilling complex information, there is no end to how AI can boost the notes you're already taking.  
  
NotebookLM is a free & private AI tool that accepts up to 50 sources. Once you've uploaded sources, you can chat with them, prepare briefing docs/summaries, and even generate an Audio Overview where two AIs create a podcast about your uploaded sources & notes 🤯  
  
Obsidian operates in markdown files & NotebookLM accepts markdown, making NotebookLM the perfect way to augment your personal knowledge management written in Obsidian.  
  
One of the main reasons I use Obsidian for my note-taking is that it operates in markdown, producing a future-proof intellectual property asset that can connect seamlessly with AI tools.  
  
I use NotebookLM almost every day in many capacities, so I'm excited to walk you through some of my favourite ways of integrating NotebookLM with Obsidian.  
  
It's truly an incredible way to take your static notes in obsidian and turn them into dynamic knowledge, while retaining the authenticity of your own writing to work WITH AI, rather than replace your thinking/writing.  
  
I hope you enjoy! ✨
