Richter, C.P. (1957). _Drowning Rats Experiment_. Psychology Studies.

**Summary:**  
Curt Richter's **1957 experiment**, often cited in **psychology literature**, aimed to explore the relationship between **psychological states (hope)** and **physical endurance**. In his study, Richter demonstrated that providing **hope** to rats **increased their survival time** when swimming. Initially, wild rats would swim for around **15 minutes** before giving up. However, introducing a **brief rescue** before re-immersing them resulted in **significantly prolonged swimming durations**, with some lasting for up to **60 hours**.

**Key Insights:**

- **Hope** and **perceived external support** can dramatically affect endurance.
- Suggests a **link** between **psychological states** and **physical survival instincts**.
- The study has implications for **resilience psychology**, **motivational theory**, and **survival behavior** in both animals and humans.

**Critique:**  
While the experiment provided important insights into the **role of hope in survival**, it has also been criticized for its **ethical implications**, as the animals were subjected to significant **stress**. Modern interpretations often highlight **ethical considerations** when conducting psychological experiments on animals.
