# [[2. Green Data Center Initiative]] 
# Overview
This analysis calculates the **carbon emissions** produced by data centers and establishes a baseline for measuring improvements toward net-zero emissions. The initial assessment covers both direct (scope 1) and indirect (scope 2 and 3) emissions.

- **Scope of Data**: Includes energy consumption, cooling costs, and emissions from supporting facilities.
- **Key Findings**: Carbon footprint exceeds initial estimates, underscoring the need for energy reduction measures.
- **Recommendations**: Transitioning to renewable sources for at least 50% of the data centerâ€™s energy needs by the end of the year.
