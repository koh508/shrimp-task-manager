# [[2. Autonomous Vehicle AI Ethics]] 
# Overview
To ensure **equitable AI behavior**, this document examines methods for identifying and eliminating bias in AI algorithms used in autonomous vehicles. Given the importance of fairness and non-discriminatory behavior in AI, this protocol aims to provide a consistent approach for testing and validating the AI's fairness.

- **Bias Detection and Auditing**:
    - **Algorithm Audits**: Regularly audit AI algorithms to detect potential biases, especially in scenarios involving pedestrian detection and decision-making.
    - **Diverse Training Data**: Ensure that the AI models are trained on diverse datasets that represent different demographics, environments, and driving scenarios.
- **Bias Correction Techniques**:
    - **Algorithm Tuning**: Adjust AI models based on bias detection results to reduce discriminatory behaviors.
    - **External Validation**: Partner with third-party auditors to validate that bias mitigation strategies are effective.
- **User Testing**: Conduct user testing to detect any potential biases in real-world applications, adjusting algorithms as needed to meet ethical standards.
