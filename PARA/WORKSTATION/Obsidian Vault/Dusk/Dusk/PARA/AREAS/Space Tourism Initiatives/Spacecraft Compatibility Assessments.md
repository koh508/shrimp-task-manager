# [[2. Space Tourism Initiatives]] 
# Overview
- **Purpose**: This note delves into the **technical assessment of compatibility** between SpaceX’s and Blue Origin’s spacecraft to enable joint missions. The initial goal is to identify potential areas for integration, focusing on critical components like docking systems, navigation interfaces, and onboard life-support systems.

- **Technical Details**: Analysis includes examining the **structural alignment** of docking ports, synchronization of **communication systems**, and adaptability of life support for varying mission lengths.

- **Expected Outcome**: By comparing each company’s spacecraft, we aim to determine compatibility adjustments and outline a joint engineering effort to enable mission synergy, especially for **orbital hotel concepts**.
