# Overview
This note explores the feasibility of building an **orbital hotel**, including the structural, financial, and logistical requirements. The concept is to create an experience akin to a luxury hotel, accommodating short stays in low-Earth orbit.

- **Technical Requirements**: Analysis of potential **station designs**, focusing on radiation protection, microgravity living adaptations, and sustainable life-support systems.
- **Market Analysis**: Preliminary projections suggest a target market of ultra-high-net-worth individuals. A survey of interest among this demographic is underway to validate this hypothesis.
- **Financials**: Preliminary costs, including construction, staffing, and long-term operational expenses, will be evaluated with finance teams from both companies.
